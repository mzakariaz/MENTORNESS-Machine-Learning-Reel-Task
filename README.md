## **Introduction**
This project is my attempt at the Reel of the Machine Learning Engineer internship at Mentorness. The goal is to introduce three clustering algorithms and present them in a short video. The approach taken for this task is creating a dataset from randomly generated numbers, and apply the clustering algorithms to it.

## **Details**
* **<u>Project Title:</u>** *Reel Task*
* **<u>Project Description:</u>** You will create an original, 30-second to 1-minute video on the topic mentoned via email with voiceovers. Submit via the provided form with the title and the video file by the deadline (02 June 2024).
* **<u>Project Submission:</u>** All of the work to be evaluated for this project is found in the `clustering-algorithms.mp4` file, located in the current directory.
* **<u>Libraries Used:</u>** The following libraries were used for the stated purposes:
  - `numpy`, for numerical calculations;
  - `scipy`, for scientific computing;
  - `sympy`, for symbolic mathematics;
  - `pandas`, for data analysis;
  - `matplotlib.pyploy`, for data visualisation;
  - `seaborn`, for data visualisation, and;
  - `sklearn.cluster`, to implement the clustering algorithms, specifically through the `KMeans`, `DBSCAN` and `AgglomerativeClustering` modules.
